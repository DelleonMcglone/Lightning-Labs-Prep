# ⚡ Lightning Labs Prep — Bitcoin & Lightning Network Study

A public, in-progress record of my work building deep Bitcoin and Lightning
Network expertise — node operation, channel liquidity, and the Lightning Labs
software suite (LND, Pool, Loop, Faraday). Everything here is original notes,
diagrams, setup logs, and source-code analysis produced as I work through a
structured learning sprint.

**Goal:** demonstrate verifiable, hands-on Lightning expertise through public
proof of work, and build toward contributing to the Lightning ecosystem.

> This repo is updated continuously as I move through the sprint. Commit history
> is the timeline.

## Contents

### Foundations

- [01 — Bitcoin Fundamentals](./01-bitcoin-fundamentals.md) — architecture, UTXOs, wallets, transactions
- [02 — Lightning Fundamentals](./02-lightning-fundamentals.md) — channels, HTLCs, liquidity glossary
- [03 — Lightning Liquidity](./03-lightning-liquidity.md) — inbound capacity, merchant liquidity, LSPs
- [04 — Pool: Auctions & Lease Pricing](./04-pool-auctions-lease-pricing.md) — sealed-bid batch auctions, ppb rates, lease economics
- [05 — Pool: Observations from Running It Live](./05-pool-observations.md) — hands-on findings, theory vs. practice, L402 debugging

### Hands-on Setup

- [Bitcoin Core setup](./setup/bitcoin-core.md) — install, configure, sync, verify
- [LND setup](./setup/lnd.md) — install, configure, connect to Bitcoin Core
- [Pool setup](./setup/pool.md) — clone, configure, connect to LND
- [Lightning operations](./setup/operations.md) — opening, funding, sending, receiving

### Source-Code Analysis

- [Pool](./repo-reviews/pool.md) — auction engine, lease pricing, APIs
- [LND](./repo-reviews/lnd.md) — architecture, routing, RPC interfaces
- [Loop](./repo-reviews/loop.md) — Loop In / Loop Out workflows
- [Faraday](./repo-reviews/faraday.md) — channel analytics, recommendation engine

### Diagrams

- [/diagrams](./diagrams) — concept diagrams for liquidity, auctions, and architecture

### Writing

Long-form articles explaining what I've learned:

- [What Is a Lightning Pool? A Beginner's Guide to the Liquidity Marketplace](./writing/what-is-lightning-pool.md) — the inbound-liquidity problem, LCLs, and the sealed-bid batch auction
- [How Lightning Liquidity Works: A Beginner's Guide to Moving Money on Lightning](./writing/how-lightning-liquidity-works.md) — inbound vs. outbound, the channel seesaw, rebalancing and fees
- [How Pool Solves Inbound Liquidity: Turning a Scramble Into a Marketplace](./writing/how-pool-solves-inbound-liquidity.md) — LCLs, premium vs. principal, and why the market actually fixes the problem

### Project

- **AI Liquidity Advisor** — an LLM-assisted tool that reads node state and
  recommends liquidity actions. **Working MVP** in [/advisor](./advisor):
  read-only collectors (lnd + Pool + Loop + mempool), deterministic signal
  and recommendation engines, Claude advisory layer with a privacy filter
  and number contract, ingestion history with trend-aware rules, CLI and a
  local web UI with grounded chat. [Spec](./advisor/SPEC.md) ·
  [Demo script](./advisor/DEMO.md). _(Demo video to follow.)_
