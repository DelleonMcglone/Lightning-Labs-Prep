# Lightning Liquidity Advisor

A **read-only, recommend-only** tool that reads a Lightning (`lnd`) node's actual
state and gives plain-language, actionable liquidity recommendations. It never
moves funds.

> Full design in [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md). This is the reference implementation,
> built milestone by milestone against that spec. **Current status: M1
> (signal engine).**

## What works today (M0 + M1)

- Connects to `lnd` over gRPC with a **read-only macaroon** (never `admin`).
- Collects a typed `NodeSnapshot` — identity, balances, per-channel
  inbound/outbound liquidity, and 30-day forwarding history.
- `advisor snapshot` prints it as a readable report (or `--json`).
- `advisor signals` computes deterministic liquidity signals: per-channel
  balance/imbalance, uptime, routing performance normalized per
  capacity-day, and **Faraday-style IQR outlier flags** (the IQR port is
  unit-tested against Faraday's own documented example). Private and
  too-young channels are filtered before statistics, exactly like Faraday.

Market + fee collectors (M2), the recommendation engine (M3), and the LLM
advisor (M4) follow the [roadmap](./SPEC.md#8-roadmap). The
[knowledge base](./knowledge/) that M4 will load is drafted.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd advisor
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
./scripts/gen_proto.sh          # generate gRPC stubs from vendored protos

# Point at your node (defaults target the local testnet lnd; all overridable)
export ADVISOR_LND_HOST=localhost:10010
export ADVISOR_NETWORK=testnet

advisor snapshot                # human-readable
advisor snapshot --json         # machine-readable
```

By default the Advisor reads
`<lnddir>/data/chain/bitcoin/<network>/readonly.macaroon` and `<lnddir>/tls.cert`.
Override with `ADVISOR_LNDDIR`, `ADVISOR_MACAROON_PATH`, `ADVISOR_TLS_CERT_PATH`,
or the `--network` / `--host` flags.

### Least-privilege credential (recommended)

Bake a scoped read-only macaroon so the Advisor is *incapable* of moving funds:

```bash
lncli bakemacaroon info:read offchain:read onchain:read \
  --save_to advisor.macaroon
export ADVISOR_MACAROON_PATH=$PWD/advisor.macaroon
```

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest        # or: python tests/test_models.py
```

## Safety

The Advisor is architecturally read-only (SPEC NFR1–NFR2): it loads a macaroon
without write/sign permissions and imports no fund-moving RPCs. It emits the
commands to act on a recommendation; **you** run them.
