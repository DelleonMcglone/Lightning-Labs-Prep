"""Local web UI for the Advisor: recommendation views + a grounded chat.

Design (mirrors the CLI's guarantees):
- The **recommendation views** render the deterministic engine's output
  verbatim — severity, economics, commands. No LLM in that path.
- The **chat** is the conversational surface: Claude answers questions
  grounded in the same knowledge base + the *sanitized* current report
  (privacy filter applies to everything that leaves the machine). Chat
  replies are clearly labeled conversational; the recommendation cards
  remain the authoritative numbers.
- No API key → views still work fully; chat explains it's offline.

Run with:  advisor serve  (default http://127.0.0.1:8899)

You are in CHAT mode: the operator asks free-form questions. Ground every
answer in the CURRENT REPORT provided and the domain knowledge. If asked
about actions, point at the matching recommendation's command rather than
inventing new figures. If a needed number isn't in the report, say so.

COMMAND RULE (critical): if you share a CLI command, copy it CHARACTER-FOR-
CHARACTER from a recommendation's "command" field in the report. Never
reconstruct commands or substitute flag values — a converted or recomputed
flag (e.g. writing an APR where a per-term percent belongs) produces a
broken order. If the report has no command for it, describe the action in
words and say the report doesn't include a priced command.
